I’m usually running late in the morning. No matter what I hit snooze at least a few times and I find it pretty difficult to roll out of bed {especially as the mornings get colder}. Since I rarely find extra time in the morning, I always save my breakfast for when I’m settled into my desk at work. Which means I need something I can just grab and go. I’m a huge fan of oatmeal with peanut butter and [overnight oats](overnight oats), but I wanted something that I wouldn’t have to prep the night before. Next quick breakfast option: mini-omelets. They were super easy to make over the weekend {I used [this recipe](http://www.chaosandloveshop.com/2012/01/easy-breakfast-idea-muffin-tin-eggs/)} and I suddenly had a nutritious easy breakfast for the entire week. They freeze and re-heat really well. Can’t get much better than that!
