Lately, aside from the cold I’m trying to get rid of, I’ve been enjoying all that’s good in an Iowa summer. The weather has turned warm, but hasn’t yet reached the thick mugginess one normally associates with summer in the mid-west. Fresh fruits and veggies, outdoor time with the dog {and cat!}, pure laziness on nights and weekends. I’ll savor it for as long as I can.

1. Charlie, making a rare appearance and even rarer, offering up some snuggles
2. Summer in Iowa calls for Moscow Mules!
3. This guy❤
4. 14-year cicadas. These little buggars are LOUD
5. Took a mid-week day off for some R&R. And ate a pound of cherries Mmmm
