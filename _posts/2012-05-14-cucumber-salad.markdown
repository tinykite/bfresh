This dinner was seriously rockin’. We made two different pork roasts: [this one](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pork-tenderloin-with-dijon-marsala-sauce/) and a balsamic recipe from Brian’s aunt Jo {amazing}. Served alongside was a cucumber salad {used [this recipe](http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/vegetables/r/cukessourcream.htm)} and potatoes from a box {yes indeed :}. Unfortunately we got so involved with getting everything coordinated and cooked, I didn’t get any pictures! Instead, I’ll leave you to feast your eyes on the [dessert](http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Strawberry-Trifle) we made earlier in the day – we managed to capture a few delectable shots.

p.s. Mom – when you come down here next we will make you a belated Mother’s Day dinner.
