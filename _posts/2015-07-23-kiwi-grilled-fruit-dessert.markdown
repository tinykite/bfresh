One of my favorite summer activities is grilling. Itâ€™s quick, easy and the cleanup is so much simpler. And I canâ€™t say I miss the smell of dinner that typically lingers in the house well after weâ€™re done eating. Sure, I love fish but I donâ€™t need the smell accompanying my morning coffee.

There are countless grilling options out there, and not all are limited to dinner. Iâ€™ve spotted some lovely inspiration, but lack the amount of time to try them all, not to mention the extra room needed in the pantsðŸ˜‰. This one turned out as quick and easy as expected, and being as how it mostly consisted of fruit, I felt pairing it with a chilled glass of rosÃ©  justified the added indulgence.

p.s. Iâ€™m crossing my fingers that this post is not a random fluke and that Iâ€™ll be back here again in the near future. I think Iâ€™ve had a long enough hiatus.
