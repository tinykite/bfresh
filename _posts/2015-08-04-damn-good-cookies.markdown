I’ve had this recipe flagged for quite some time now {originally found here}. But it seems whenever I have a craving to make something sweet, I usually want it like 10 minutes ago. Unfortunately this recipe takes time. Fortunately it’s totally worth it. Even my husband, who typically doesn’t like sweets at all {especially those of the chocolate variety} thought they were pretty good. I think we have the bittersweet chocolate and sea salt to thank for that tiny miracle. The good thing is the recipe makes a pretty decent sized batch of dough which can be thrown in the fridge or freezer {thus making it much easier to satisfy cravings that have no patience for recipes such as these}.

As evidenced below in a couple photos, I tried creating my own break-and-bake {err, cut-and-bake} cookies to make things easier going from fridge to oven, but it appears I need to refine the process a little. The cookies turned out oddly shaped and I’m guessing they didn’t bake quite as evenly {to be fair I had the stroke of genius for these homemade break-and-bakes after I had already refrigerated my dough}. Next time though I will roll out and wrap with precision. And it will be amazing. Well, more amazing. These cookies are amazing no matter what shape they end up in.

And truly, the sea salt is a game changer. No joke.
