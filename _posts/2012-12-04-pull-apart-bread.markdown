The Pioneer Woman strikes again. This time she had me salivating over her pull-apart bread with drizzly, dripping deliciousness icing. This stuff is crazy good. And addicting. I now understand how deadly pull-apart bread can be. Itâ€™s so easy to pull off just small pieces at a time that you donâ€™t think youâ€™ve done much damage until you see the nearly empty plate on your counter {may or may not have happened over here}.

It was fairly easy to make BUT I made one fatal mistake {and I tend to do this often with my baked goods} â€“ I took it out of the pan too soon. And by too soon I mean I removed it immediately after pulling it from the oven. Ooops. So while I attempted to take some decent photos of the finished product, it looks like a complete blob. But let me assure you, it tastes much better than it looks. And it made my kitchen smell like ChristmasðŸ™‚
