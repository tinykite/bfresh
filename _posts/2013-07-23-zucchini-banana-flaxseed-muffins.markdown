 I took to [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/bmarie/nums/) over the weekend, hoping to continue my quest of making everything on my food board. As I went perusing, I resided myself to something snack-like, somewhat sweet but not a dessert, something that I could graze on over the next few days. [This one](http://www.marthastewart.com/851872/zucchini-banana-and-flaxseed-muffins?xsc=soc_pin_ZucchiniBananaFlaxseedMuffins&crlt.pid=camp.ryq4tb5rovaU) popped up early on in my search and I was sold. As far as breakfast foods go I will almost always opt for a muffin/pastry/donut over eggs/bacon/sausage. Even though I’ve been trying to limit the sweet intake lately I figured these were good to go – they have flaxseed in them for goodness sake! Flaxseed muffins that taste good! I’ve been snacking on them ever since.
