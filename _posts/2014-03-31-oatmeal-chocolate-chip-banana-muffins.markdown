Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my all time favorite cookies, so it’s not surprising that I decided to try out this [healthier version](http://fitandhealthywithdebbie.blogspot.com/2012/10/banana-oatmeal-breakfast-muffins.html#.UzoUhFdMiEE). Truly, the ingredient list intrigued me – no sugar? no flour? greek yogurt? And while a bit shrimpy {I may have been a little stingy when pouring the batter into the muffin cups} these actually turned out really really well. I omitted the flax seed since I was fresh out and it didn’t seem to make a difference. A little cinnamon was tossed in for some added nutty flavor. And while the chocolate chips weren’t in the original recipe, I just couldn’t resist. Do you think I can still call these healthy after I’ve consumed 5 of them in about 5 minutes?
