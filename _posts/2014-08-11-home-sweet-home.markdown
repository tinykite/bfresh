Iâ€™m so excited to share that weâ€™ve purchased and moved into our first home! Itâ€™s been a whirlwind of a couple of months. I never thought weâ€™d find a house so quickly, and subsequently close just as quickly. Weâ€™ve upgraded in quite a few regards {size, yard, neighborhood} but the upgrade Iâ€™m most excited for is my kitchen. I canâ€™t wait to cook and blog in this space, sharing everything along with you all of courseðŸ™‚ I feel incredibly blessed to be in this new space and sharing it with my two best guys. Itâ€™s definitely a new chapter in our lives, one that we are fully embracing with thankful, open arms. Now for the daunting task of decoratingâ€¦not my strongest point, but Iâ€™m determined. Pinterest here I come!ðŸ™‚
