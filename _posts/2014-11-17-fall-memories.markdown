It’s hard to believe that just three weeks ago I was biking around Iowa in 70+ degree weather. Snow has since arrived and the temperature is currently sitting at a balmy 16 degrees.

Winter is here.

It’s an inevitable occurrence that most mid-westerners initially dread. And yet I found myself admiring the icy beauty and feeling grateful to live in a place where I can experience the four seasons so distinctly.

Until next year I can only think fondly on those warm fall days we had. It was indeed one of the best falls I can remember.
