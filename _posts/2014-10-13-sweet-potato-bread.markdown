I am fully on board with fall flavors, ready to incorporate any and all of the season’s most typical produce into any and all meals. I’m especially intrigued by non-traditional uses of some of the veggies and decided to kick-off the fall baking season with this [sweet potato bread recipe](http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/04/cinnamon-and-spice-sweet-potato-bread.html). The flavors were phenomenal and I highly, highly recommend the recipe. Just be sure to have an iron-clad steaming method. I dried out the sweet potatoes and the dryness definitely translated into the bread. And yet, the flavors more than made up for it. I see this bread happening again in my very near future.
