I was searching for something tasty to eat over the weekend and a common theme kept popping up in the recipes I found – brown butter. I’ve heard of it, but had never cooked with it. I was mistakenly convinced it was butter mixed with brown sugar, oh how naively simple I can be! I was intrigued. And had a few overripe {well, in my opinion just perfect to be eaten} bananas that I didn’t think I’d be able to get through by the end of the weekend, so I decided to make the Amateur Gourmet’s [Brown Butter Banana Bread](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2009/04/brown_butter_ba.html). It turned out perfectly. Although, if I’m being totally honest, I’m still a little mystified by brown butter. I was so scared of burning it that I’m not sure I achieved the right nutty, auburn brown characteristics. It’s definitely something to try again!

Some notes:

-I too, had to bake my banana bread for over an hour – about 65 min and it was perfect inside and out
-I didn’t have any yogurt on hand but the 2% milk I did have worked fine
