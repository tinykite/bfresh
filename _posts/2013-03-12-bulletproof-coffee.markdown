Okay, so I really need to tell you about what I’ve been drinking lately for breakfast: [Bulletproof Coffee](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/). You’re probably going to think I’m completely bonkers when I tell you what’s in it. But let me preface this by saying my trainer is the one who introduced me to it. Ingredient list: coffee, unsalted butter and coconut oil. Yup. That’s right. When blended together it creates a frothy, latte-like, delicious, creamy drink that is pretty dang good. I know it sounds odd, but it’s loaded with healthy fats, so the more you drink it you actually train your body to start processing the right kind of fats {I think – click on the link above and read more about it}. I’ve had only this for most mornings the last week or so and it’s been fantastic. It tastes good and my energy level has been high enough to last me all the way through my midday workouts until lunch.

Note: I did have to start with less butter than the [recipe](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/) calls for and work my way up. Day one I felt a little weird. But that could have just been a mental thing because I couldn’t stop thinking about what I was actually drinking. I also use more coffee because I’m a 3-cup kind of gal. Oh and I was a little worried I wouldn’t like the taste because I normally don’t put anything in my coffee {when you have good tasting coffee you don’t need to!}. And yet I liked the drink instantly.

Try it!
