I have laundry to do, boxes to unpack and floors to vacuum {and a puppy who really deserves a walk} but all I can do is search for beautiful things to put in my house. Speaking of, where can I find amazing pillows? Kind of a little more than smitten with these from ferm LIVING but Iâ€™m balking at the price tag. Any suggestions? Any and all are welcome ðŸ™‚
