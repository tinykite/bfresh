I like baking more than cooking. I love throwing it all together and popping it in the oven. Some people hate the wait that comes after but I kind of like it. Gives me a chance to clean up the huge mess that I always end up making while sniffing the deliciousness that starts to fill the room. I need to bake more. My problem is that my fiancé doesn’t like sweets. So if I end up baking something, guess who eats the majority of it? Me. Not good. Thankfully, I’m bringing this one to work. Although I did manage to steal a bite {they won’t mind}. I’m not confident enough with my baking skills to try a new recipe out on others without first sampling it. I’ll get there.

This recipe is good. Plus I think it’s healthy because there is a vegetable in it. Ha. You can find the recipe I used [here](http://joythebaker.com/2011/10/almost-vegan-zucchini-bread/). Enjoy!
