We just had this year’s first perfectly brisk fall weekend. Despite summer’s quick passing, I’ve fully embraced the season and am ready for all things holiday-related. There are pumpkins and mums on my front porch and the cutest white pumpkin indoors {must.buy.more}. The fireplace was in use for much of the weekend and I was finally able to find something suitable to hold the firewood on the mantle. And I’m SO ready for fall flavors. Pumpkins, sweet potatoes, spices, soups and roasted vegetables. I’m always in the mood for roasted Brussels sprouts, but somehow it seems much more appropriate when the air starts to chill.
