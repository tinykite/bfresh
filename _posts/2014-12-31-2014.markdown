2014 was a pretty monumental one with the purchase of our first home. It was also filled with family, friends and some pretty great memories. I love reflecting back, but am excited to see what 2015 brings. I truly hope that wherever you are, there is peace, love and happiness. I hope 2015 is everything you wish for — and more! xo
