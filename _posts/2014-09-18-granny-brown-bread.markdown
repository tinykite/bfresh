The Irish have arrived! In celebration we made dinner for them at our house earlier this week. I made Guinness Beef Stew and Granny’s Brown Bread, which may have been a little crazy since the best stew I’ve ever had was made by Tina Cummins {Irish relative} and I had never made brown bread before.

The Guinness stew is a fantastic recipe and I’ll share it here eventually. The multiple hour prep/cook time is well worth it. As for the brown bread, it’s Tom Cummins’s Granny’s recipe and is the epitome of Irish bread. Rustic, comforting, textured wholesome-ness {I’m aware that’s not a word}. I don’t feel at liberty to share the recipe, but here’s one that is very similar.

I’ll have to re-work the one I was given. I had to convert quite a few measurements and baking temperature which may have skewed it a little. Can’t wait to try it out again and again though. I’m slightly afraid of working with yeast and bonus! this recipe doesn’t require any {and neither does the one I linked to}.
