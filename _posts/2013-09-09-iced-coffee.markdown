I like to think of myself as a bit of a coffee purist when it comes to what I put in my coffee, or should I say what I don’t put in my coffee. I stick with simple. Black. It’s the best way to drink coffee in the morning – a straight up kick in the mouth, not sweetened up, smoothed out aka diluted. I’ve felt this way for a very, very long time {not including my brief stint with [bulletproof coffee](http://justbfresh.com/2013/03/12/weekly-breakfast-coffee/)}. Until I met my new friend, iced coffee. It’s refreshing, creamy deliciousness and fits the dessert-for-breakfast desire. Someday I would LOVE to try out [The Pioneer Woman’s recipe](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2011/06/perfect-iced-coffee/), but for now I’m okay with my simple process.

I don’t really have a recipe to share, just the following ingredients:

1 cup coffee, chilled {Dunkin’ Donuts all the way!}
Desired amount of heavy whipping cream {less is more, in my opinion}
1 packet of splenda {or your desired sweetener}

Note: I recommend not pouring hot, freshly brewed coffee over a bunch of ice cubes. This keeps the coffee from being ice cold, and you end up diluting the taste with the melted cubes. I put my cup of coffee in the freezer for a little bit to cool it down quick, but I think next time I’ll make ice cubes out of coffee, so I have some extra chill for the time it takes me to drink it {which isn’t long because it’s SO good!}
