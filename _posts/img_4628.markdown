We’re really loving our new neighborhood. And while we haven’t gotten to know our neighbors super well yet, a few have come over and introduced themselves. One in particular has now brought us fresh veggies from his garden on three separate occasions. I love having homegrown vegetables around the house, and free is even better!

A couple weeks ago I had a cucumber and a couple tomatoes he had given us that were nearing the end, and oh so conveniently this recipe happened to land in my inbox. I’ve never made pasta salad at home before, but now I don’t think I’ll ever go back! So much cheaper {fresh veggies from neighbors sure doesn’t hurt} and easy to whip up. I tweaked a few things: substituted tomato for the bell pepper, skipped the cauliflower and completely forgot to toss in the broccoli. This recipe seems to be one of those that is completely customizable. Next time I’d go a little lighter on the vinegar, although Brian and his brother thought it tasted just fine.

p.s. Don’t make the mistake I did. Read fully through the recipe, so you’re aware that the chopped up veggies have to sit in the fridge for a few hours…
