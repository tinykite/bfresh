I think pears might be one of the most underrated fall fruits. Apples get quite a bit of face time with the multitude of dessert and drink recipes out there and pumpkins are the poster child for Thanksgiving {which, by the way, I didn’t even know they were a fruit until about 5 minutes ago}.

Personally, I prefer pears over apples, as long as they are ripe enough. A hard pear is just not that satisfying. Then again, one that’s too ripe isn’t all that great either. Which is possibly why they don’t pop up too often in my kitchen. Finding them at their best is far too difficult {for this inexperienced produce shopper}. And yet, once you get that perfect balance between crisp and squashy, you get a wonderful flavor that just about melts in your mouth.

And now, let’s combine it with the salty goodness that is prosciutto, sharp arugula and creamy blue cheese. It is one flavor explosion that is the epitome of holiday indulgence {get the recipe here}.

One change I would make for the next go-round would be to slice everything in half. I made this for a very small gathering, but for a larger group it would be nice to make these a little more poppable. Very small slices of pear with just a tiny strip of prosciutto holding everything together. The only thing I wouldn’t scale back is the arugula. It’s a nice offset to the rest of the rich flavors happening in that tiny space {I didn’t mention the blue cheese because the amount of it is completely a personal preference. Me? The more the better :}

Iowa made Maytag Blue Cheese is so so good and is what I used here. However, my first blue cheese love will always and forever be Cashel Blue from Ireland. It is, quite simply, amazing.
