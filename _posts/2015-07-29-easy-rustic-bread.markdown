I probably could have gone a little more clever with the title, but I think it sums up this recipe nicely. The only adjective I’m missing is lengthy. Roughly 24 hours from start to finish {albeit very little supervision needed – or baking skills}, 3 required ingredients, so so so so tasty. It’s absolutely worth the time it takes, just be sure to plan ahead.

I’ve made this bread numerous times already, and it’s been fun to play around with toppings. One of my favorites is a classic mashed up avocado with a slight dusting of sea salt. It became my go-to dinner while I was taking a couple classes this summer more often than I’d like to admit.

Another sweet and savory favorite is goat cheese with a smear of fig jam {I’m drooling a little just thinking of goat cheese….mmmm}.

Recipe originally from here but discovered here.
