Today’s main meal wasn’t quite as earth shatteringly delicious as yesterday’s, but it was a nice contrast: [Arugula, Grape and Sunflower Seed Salad](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/arugula-grape-sunflower-seed-salad-10000001734329/). I was actually more excited to make the Chickpea salad I have planned later this week, but I have a thing about squishy grapes. Blech. I like my grapes to make a satisfying crunch when I bite into the. So I figured this salad needed to happen soon.

There were some great flavors involved: peppery arugula, sweet grapes, nutty sunflower seeds and sharp dressing. The dressing was missing the maple syrup since I forgot to purchase it over the weekend, and I think that was key. I would definitely make this salad again, but most likely as a side rather than the main course. I’m a little worried about not staying full.

Notes: I used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil, did not toast the sunflower seeds and probably would have rather used half spinach half arugula rather than all arugula. Also, I think goat cheese would be awesome on top.

Here’s the breakdown for the day

1 tall glass of water with a squeeze of lemon, first thing in the morning
2 cups of coffee
Breakfast: 2 eggs, scrambled and plain
Snack: 1 banana, a few strawberries and blueberries
Lunch: Spinach salad with strawberries, blueberries and pomegranate dressing {not sure if the dressing was clean, but the ingredient list looked okay} & greek yogurt {this I’m pretty sure is not clean and I most likely won’t eat the rest of the week}
Snack: Raw almonds
Dinner: [Arugula, Grape and Sunflower Seed Salad](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/arugula-grape-sunflower-seed-salad-10000001734329/)
Dessert: TBD but I’m going to try to hold out and skip it
