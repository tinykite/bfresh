I’m in charge of bringing bread to Thanksgiving this year. It’s the first time I’ve had to be responsible for something, so I want to do it right. In addition to getting the standard rolls I will be trying out a couple fun bread recipes in hopes one might work out.

In looking at different recipes for inspiration I stumbled across [this one](http://www.mybakingaddiction.com/crock-pot-slow-cooker-apple-butter-recipe/). Not bread, but what a delicious compliment to the bread I’ll be bringing. Plus, an added bonus: cute hostess gift for my aunt! You need to have a full day free to do this, but the good thing is you can let it be for the most part. Unless you have a nifty apple slicer (which I regretfully don’t) the slicing is a little time consuming. I did enjoy it though, as there is something relaxing about it. Plus it gave me time to reflect on the first time I ever tried apple butter. I must have been fairly young. It was at my grandma’s house and now every time I eat it, I think of her.
