I’ve always loved making resolutions. They’re usually filled with hope and promise of a new year. Filled with expectations and sweet anticipation of the things I want to accomplish, places I want to visit, memories I want to make. Wipe the slate of last year and make room for new desires.

And yet I didn’t make any this year. Something held me back. Maybe it was the failings of past resolutions. Could be I haven’t gotten the chance to de-scramble my cluttered brain.

Or, it’s possible I simply want to re-focus on what I started in 2014.

In my yoga class the other night, my teacher took a poll of how many in the room had set resolutions. Only a small fraction of us had. She challenged us instead to set an intention for the year. And that feels better to me. It feels open, not so decisive and final.

I’m going to re-focus on my theme from last year: mindfulness. It’s such a positive way to approach every aspect of life. And while I have a long was to go, it’s the baby steps I’ll continue to work on and celebrate. I challenge you to do the same.
