Winter seems to suck all the moisture out of my body, leaving my skin feeling rough and dry. I try slathering on lotion as often as I can, but I usually forget that extra hydration is just as {if not more}, important. I’m not terrible about drinking water, but I definitely don’t go above and beyond the bare minimum. Between the dry winter air and my frequency in the hot yoga studio, I should probably be drinking a lot more than 64 ounces a day. And sadly, I don’t think I’m even getting close to that.

A few weeks back I made some infused water, wanting to do something a little different that looked and tasted good. This Strawberry & Lemon Infused Water recipe turned out really well, so I decided to whip up another batch. I’m letting it infuse overnight and will gulp down a big glass of it each morning this week. The lemon will be a great kick-start to the day and the strawberries are just sweet enough that it’s something I can actually look forward to, instead of viewing it as something I have to do.

Are there any infused water combos you’ve tried and enjoyed? I’d love to hear!
