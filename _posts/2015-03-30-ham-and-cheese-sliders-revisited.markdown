I perused my recipe page the other day, feeling fairly uninspired in the kitchen. I came across the ham and cheese sliders that we first made over two years ago {!! – about time I revisited}. At the time I wasn’t overly impressed, and I’m SO glad I finally gave it a second try. The recipe is actually quite good and I really must emphasize the fact that the less than ideal results I originally achieved were of my own making.

Some thoughts/details:
-red onion worked wonderfully
-more mustard for next time
-replace butter with olive oil? {the sliders were SO good, but SO rich}
-CUSTOMIZE! These would honestly be really good with other meat/cheese combos, especially as an app for a party {same glaze tho}
-poppy seeds are an absolute must – the additional crunch makes them extra special
-use real cheese {not shredded like I did last time}

The best part? Easy and FAST! Perfect for a weeknight meal option!
