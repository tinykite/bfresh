Last Friday I took the afternoon off and spent the day relaxing outside. And after a fairly full work week, I was ready to enjoy the great outdoors with an adult beverage in hand. Wine is my go-to drink. Red wine, to be more specific. But it doesnâ€™t complement warm weather very well. So I decided to lighten and freshen it up with some sparkling water, thus creating a wine spritzer. The first few sips were not overly impressive, but then it grew on me. It was definitely refreshing, and by cutting my normal glass of wine in half, I was saving on calories. And I could take down a few more and not feel too shnockeredðŸ™‚

p.s. Thereâ€™s some really great recipes out there that spruce these up a little, like [this one](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/wine-spritzer-recipe.html) from Giada.
