I’ve been told that ricotta cheese makes the fluffiest pancakes. I’m more partial to french toast so it took me awhile to try them out but I am convinced. The cheese, in combination with the lemon made pancakes that were so light, airy and fresh, I forgot I was eating a carb. Topped off with wild choke cherry syrup from the Rocky Mountain foothills, these pancakes were little short of perfection. I’ll never buy the box mix again.

Note: I used about 3/4 the amount of lemon juice that the recipe called for, the full amount would have been a little too overwhelming for my tastes. If you choose to cut it also, you may need to substitute some other liquid to keep the batter from getting too thick. I added a little milk since I had it on hand and it worked fine.
