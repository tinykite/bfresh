Aside from a bowl of cereal, this is one of the easiest things to whip up for breakfast. They are delicious, simple and {dare I say} healthy? Two ingredients. Yes. Just two. One egg and half a banana mashed up will give you a few decent sized pancakes. Here I topped them with cinnamon and some maple syrup, but I tried them the other day with just cinnamon and they were still amazingly delicious and sweet. If thatâ€™s just too darn simple for you, feel free to customize. I can think of so many summer fruits that would complement these quite nicely.

See the original recipe from [A Cup of Jo](http://joannagoddard.blogspot.com/2014/04/two-ingredient-pancakes.html).
