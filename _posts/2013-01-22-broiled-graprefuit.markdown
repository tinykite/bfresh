It’s citrus season! While I typically stick with oranges and clementines, every once in awhile I get a taste for grapefruit. The only way I can usually make myself eat the tart fruit is by adding a generous amount of sugar. [When I saw this recipe](http://simplysugarandglutenfree.com/broiled-grapefruit-recipe/) on [pinterest](http://pinterest.com/bmarie/) I knew I had to give it a try, knowing that both grapefruit and cinnamon have great health benefits. It was sooo good. Even better, it was super quick throwing it together. I’d even be willing to drag myself out of bed 5 min earlier to have this for breakfast! I think next time I will extend the broil time {I had already doubled it from the original recipe} and add a touch more cinnamon. Oh and get my hands on a grapefruit spoon.
