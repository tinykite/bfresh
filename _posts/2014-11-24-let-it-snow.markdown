If you follow me on Instagram, you’ve already seen these, but I wanted to share them regardless because I think they are just lovely.

These photos were taken on a trail that runs right behind our neighborhood. It was quiet, peaceful and felt a little magical {the first snow of the season is always so special, isn’t it?}. I know everyone wants winter to come and go quickly, but I want more snow!!

The temps in Iowa rose a little this past weekend, melting most of the snow we received the day I took these photos. It’s now very cold again. And if it’s going to be cold, we’d better have some gosh darn snow.
