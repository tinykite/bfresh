A few weeks ago I was feeling particularly unhealthy, so I started kicking back smoothies, eating raw until 4pm {most days} and cutting back on the amount of wine I was drinking. While my waste line hasn’t shrunk quite as rapidly as I’d hoped {or really much at all}, I have been feeling better in general, which I suppose is the best reason to eat more fruits and veggies.

I’ve also re-discovered my [magic bullet](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Bullet-MBR-1701-17-Piece-Express/dp/B001WAKFDY), which was a Christmas gift back in 2013. It’s the perfect single-serve blender and makes smoothie making a breeze, even with the very limited amount of time I typically allow myself most mornings.

One of my favorite smoothies is kiwi-mango-mint, first found in the [100 Best Smoothies and Juices](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Smoothies-Juices-Parragon-Books/dp/1407595687) book I impulse purchased at Barnes & Noble {you know those crafty little stacks they place near the front of the store…I’m a sucker every time}.

My current ratio:
1/2 mango
2 kiwis
3/4 c pineapple/orange juice
Mint leaves {I like a pretty generous bunch}

Fresh, tasty and the mint is great for digestion.

p.s. – added bonus to the magic bullet – the container you blend in instantly becomes your to-go cup!
