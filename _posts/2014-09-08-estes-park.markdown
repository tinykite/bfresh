It seems I have a bazillion photos/posts about Colorado on this site {here, here, here, here, and here}. I think itâ€™s kind of like good friends and good hair products though â€“ you can never have too manyðŸ˜‰

In looking back through some old posts, itâ€™s amazing how vastly different each trip has been. And yet every time the same feelings wash over me and soak into my skin. Contentment, equanimity â€” itâ€™s like thereâ€™s this constant strain of work and other commitments, and I often times feel pulled like a rubber band until snap! Iâ€™m finally released and floating on the tranquility and quietude of Colorado bliss. It soaks into my skin and penetrates my soul.

Maybe a little dramatic, but hey, I love this place.
