I love coffee so much, it was only a matter of time before I started slathering it all over my body. Ha. No but really. This is a thing. I’ve pinned quite a few at home masks, treatments, etc. Why not start with one who’s ingredients I fully support: coffee, sugar, coconut oil and cinnamon. The caffeine in the coffee tightens, cane sugar exfoliates, coconut oil moisturizes and cinnamon clears away bacteria. Click here to get the recipe and read up on the benefits of each ingredient.

I’ve been using the scrub for a few days now, and while I can’t see any visible changes yet {some sites I read claimed this scrub eliminates cellulite}, my skin feels great. Smoother, softer, healthier. I’m hoping it does good things for the rear end area, and I’ve been smearing it all over my stomach in the hopes that I will get great abs with minimal effort {ha!}. So far I’m loving it. The coconut oil feels amazing and I love the smell of the coffee on my skin.

So how about the cons:
-Not sure about this going down the drain in my shower. I think it’s okay, but I’d be careful if you have older pipes.
-It’s messy. Coffee grinds everywhere in the shower. I don’t mind because I have a removal shower head and I just rinse everything down when I’m done but if you don’t you may find this terribly irritating.
-Not sure how much you can store at one time. The recipe in the link above will last me maybe another day or so {for a total of 5-6 days} which is fine. I’d be a little hesitant to make more at one time. Wet coffee grinds can get moldy, but maybe not when mixed with these other ingredients?

Let me know if you try it or have tried it!
