Blueberries are nowhere near being in season, but I had a hankering for a muffin over the weekend. I’ve made [this recipe](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/08/perfect-blueberry-muffins/) numerous times and each time it turns out fabulous. I was initially drawn to it because sour cream was one of the listed ingredients. I’ll make just about anything that involves sour cream. I don’t know what it is, but there’s something about making blueberry muffins from scratch that makes me feel so gosh darn good.
