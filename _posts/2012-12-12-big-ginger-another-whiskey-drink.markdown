Even though this one is not a hot whiskey drink {like [this one](http://justbfresh.com/2012/10/10/hot-toddy/) and [this one](http://justbfresh.com/2012/10/25/hot-whiskey/)}, it’s sure to keep you warm this winter. It’s no fuss with the right amount of ginger ale {which compliments the whiskey well} and one lemon and one lime. Per usual, I chose to go with the Irish whiskey – it was delicious. Enjoy!
