My nephew turned three a couple of weeks ago and I made myself in charge of the pre-birthday treats. I wanted to make something fun and playful, but not overly complicated {my decorating skills are extremely limited}. Funfetti cake mix, creative frosting and accessories all met together to create what I would consider fantastically simple and fun cupcakes.

I chose a tip from my cupcake decorating kit that I thought would resemble grass and colored the frosting green. A trip over to Nobbies produced a bag full of tiny dinosaurs that worked perfectly as toppers. Although the cupcakes turned out super cute, I think my nephew was more excited about all the new dinosaurs he got to play with. Next yearâ€™s challenge: Angry Birds
