I know Iâ€™ve been pretty absent this past month. I promise Iâ€™ll be back eventually. I have a brand new kitchen Iâ€™ve been getting some use out of. And the light that comes streaming in is pretty great. Someday Iâ€™ll share some photos once Iâ€™ve gotten around to unpacking the stacks of boxes weâ€™ve managed to shove into corners and hanging something on the walls. For now Iâ€™ll share with you my first official meal in the place {Iâ€™m not counting the ones that have come off the grill â€“ I want to get a little more sophisticated with my grilling skills first}.

This Chicken Schnitzel comes from the August issue of Cooking Light, and per usual I was a little unsure as to Brianâ€™s reaction. The chicken was somewhat unremarkable based on the ingredient list and the featured side of Smashed Mustard Potatoes seriously lacked some milk and butter. And yet, he thought the dinner was fantastic. Not sure if he was just extra hungry that night but I wonâ€™t complain. I love when he actually enjoys the healthier options I force on himðŸ˜‰

Sidenote: I made the Apple, Fennel & Celery Slaw that was also featured as part of this meal. Found out I strongly dislike fennel {tastes like black licorice} but I really love the combination of honey and cider vinegar, tossed with green apples and celery. Would definitely have that again. And I usually strongly dislike celery {unless completely smothered in peanut butter}.

Hint for anyone buying me a Christmas present this year: subscription to Cooking Light. Iâ€™m kind of diggin it.
