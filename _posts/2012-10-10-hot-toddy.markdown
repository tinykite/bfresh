I’ve been feeling a little under the weather for the past week or so and have been opting for the self-medicated route of a good ‘ole whiskey drink. I had heard of a hot toddy {recipe here} but have never elected to try one. So glad I did! Even when I’m feeling back to normal I think this drink will stick with me through the cold winter months.
