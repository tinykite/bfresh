I was perusing [my pinterest page](http://pinterest.com/bmarie/nums/) and realized out of all the items I’ve pinned to my “Nums” page, I’ve barely made anything {I don’t think I’m alone in this}. And then I pinned these [energy -balls- bites](http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/no-bake-energy-bites/). I’m always on the search for a healthier snack that’s tasty and this one more than fit the bill. It was super easy to throw together, took hardly no time at all, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted {I nixed the coconut flakes however because, well, blech}! Hard to believe, but it even satisfied my sweet tooth! I am sure these will be gone soon and I’ll be making another batch right away.
