After a few days of unseasonably warm weather, the temperature plummeted. It went from the 70s to the very low 40s {and probably lower tonight}. On my drive home I was craving a warm drink. Enter Hot Toddy’s cousin: Hot Whiskey. Has a bit more bite but it’s warming me up well enough. I think I need to find a few more hot drinks for the upcoming season. Fall is fleeting and winter is just around the corner…
