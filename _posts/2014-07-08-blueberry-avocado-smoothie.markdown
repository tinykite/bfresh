I know myself pretty well. And I know that one of hardest things for me when trying to eat healthy, is avoiding the sweets. My sweet tooth is insanely out of control, and is usually pretty difficult to reign in. So again, being prepared was key here. I stocked up on quite a few fruits to snack on raw, as well as to toss into the magic bullet to make quick smoothies.

This one was simple and turned our pretty well. And it served its purpose in curbing any after dinner cravings.

I didn’t stick strictly to any recipe, but this blueberry avocado one served as inspiration. Also want to try the sweet/spicy one on that site.

What I ended up with:
About a cup of frozen berries
1 banana
1/2 an avocado
Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk – not sure how much I ended up with, just use as much as you need to get the desired consistency
Blend up in a Magic Bullet {makes a perfect single serving}
