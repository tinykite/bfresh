I’ve been drinking hot apple cider for as long as I can remember, and will almost always opt for it over hot chocolate {crazy considering how much chocolate typically runs my life}. I decided it was finally time I made some from scratch instead of using those pre-made packets {which I actually love btw}. And can I just clarify that by scratch I mean I bought some apple cider and added my own spices. I’m not ambitious enough to squeeze out my own apple cider. This recipe turned out pretty well. I loved the maple syrup flavor but next time may cut it in half. If you like your cider real sweet though, this recipe is for you!
