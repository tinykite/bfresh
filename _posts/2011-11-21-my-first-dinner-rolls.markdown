Since I’m in charge of bringing the bread for Thanksgiving this year, I wanted to test out a couple recipes beforehand. One in particular is for dinner rolls {I used [this one](http://www.ourbestbites.com/2009/10/worlds-best-dinner-rolls/)}. I’ve never made bread without a bread machine. I am not sure why, but baking with yeast has always intimidated me and I’ve never actually tried it until now. During the process there were a few “oh crap” moments when I thought I had completely failed {which is depressing at 11pm after hours of work}, but somehow they came out exactly how they should. They’re not quite up to Lulu’s perfect brown bread standard, but overall I’m pretty pleased with myself. Now I just need to make the magic happen again in a couple days.
