There are certain foods/condiments that, when included in the list of ingredients, have enough pull to entice me into giving the recipe a shot. The ones that rise to the top of the list: sour cream, avocados and lately, Greek yogurt [{here’s one tasty example}](http://justbfresh.com/2014/03/31/oatmeal-chocolate-chip-banana-muffins/). There was no hesitation on my part with [these muffins](http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/blueberry-avocado-muffins/). The original recipe calls for blueberries but since I had blackberries on hand {they’ve been so inexpensive lately!} I improvised. I was surprised at how well they worked out. Another substitute that would be fantastic? Chocolate chips. These turned out deliciously dense and not overly sweet. The perfect accompaniment to a morning coffee.
