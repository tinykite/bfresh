While I love my hot whiskey drinks {here and here}, mulled wine really steals my heart. Itâ€™s a lot more work but so worth it! Itâ€™s where brandy and wine meet, and mixed with the right spices it smells like Christmas!! The whiskey drinks are for cold weather, but mulled wine is truly the drink for the holidays. I loosely followed [this recipe](http://wine.about.com/od/holidayswithwine/r/MulledWines.htm), but sort of just tossed everything together a little haphazardly. Make it! Itâ€™s good!ðŸ™‚
