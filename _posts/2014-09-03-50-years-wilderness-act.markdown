We spent Labor Day weekend in Estes Park, CO. And while it’s definitely not even close to being remote, it felt so good to be in such close proximity of one of the great landmarks of this county: the Rocky Mountains. Coincidentally I received in my inbox today, an article about the 50-year anniversary of the Wilderness Act. Click here to see some beautiful photos of newly designated and proposed wilderness.
