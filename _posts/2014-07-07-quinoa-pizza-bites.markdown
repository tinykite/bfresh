Well the weekend certainly did me in. Lots of eating and lots of drinking, resulting in a few more wobbly bits to contend with. Healthy eating commence!

The typical weaknesses that arise during my healthy lifestyle attempts can be largely attributed to a lack of preparation {as well as my overall lack of self control around all things sweet and savory}. So my main goal yesterday was to completely eliminate this one obstacle. The rest I will just hope for the best…

I’ve got a fridge full of fruits and veggies and a list of new recipes to try {because really I get more excited to try out new ones – maybe I’ll eat healthier if it’s new??…}

I’m bound and determined to pack my breakfast and lunch each and every night {I work waayyyy too early to make/eat breakfast at home}. This will reduce the temptations to run out for lunch…Des Moines, where are we at with getting a healthy fast-food joint? In addition, I’ve planned out a mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack every day to hopefully keep me from getting too hangry and giving in to unnecessary binges.

Salads for dinner. Salads for dinner. Salads for dinner. If I could eat a salad for dinner even just a few nights a week, significant progress would be made. I’ve got 5 for the week on my list – 3 of which are new and I’m hoping are so deliciously amazing my brain will forget I’m eating veggies. I’ll be sure to share if they pass the test…

And finally, I’m getting my butt back on the mat. Between a nasty summer cold, some travel and some new house plans in the works I’ve been seriously neglecting this part of my life. My yoga practice is crucial in getting back in gear and helps significantly in the detox department.

Now, back to being prepared. I mentioned having snacks ready and available is crucial. I made Quinoa Pizza Bites yesterday to serve as my afternoon snacks for the week. They turned out amazing. I was forced to exercise some serious discipline last night, as I was ready to eat the entire batch. I tested the re-heat today at work and they were a tasty, filling snack that took me through the rest of the evening and my yoga sculpt class.

p.s. the dipping sauce is clutch
