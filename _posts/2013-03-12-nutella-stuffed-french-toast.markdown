Weekends are special. Obviously because they are a much needed break from the work week {for most}, but when the house is clean and you have nowhere to be, they are downright magical. Especially rainy mornings. With coffee. And something delectable to eat. I pinned [this recipe](http://www.justataste.com/2012/02/banana-and-nutella-stuffed-french-toast/) just a few days ago and knew I had to make it soon. I’ve never actually made french toast before – what a recipe to start with! I’m not sure any others can measure up. It was basically dessert for breakfast, and restaurant style good. Positively oozing nutella with ‘nanners all over the place. YUM.
