When I moved back into normal corporate life after a little over a year in retail, one of the {many} things I was excited for and had been missing was food day! We’ve had some great ones so far, themed and un-themed. The nice thing is that my co-workers are such willing guinea pigs, and tomorrow will be no exception. I wanted to try out a classic cheesy potato dish – the [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/cheesy-potato-casserole-recipe/index.html) is easy enough and has all the tasty {and unfortunately not-so-good-for-you} essentials: potatoes, gobs of cheese and cream. I prepped part of the work last night, {all the chopping and most of the layering} saving just a small amount of work for the morning. Since I’ll be bringing it to work, I am going to transfer it to my small crock pot after it comes out of the oven. We’ll see how it turns out!

On a completely unrelated note, I was listening to [this](http://www.npr.org/2011/11/11/142230949/wilco-small-moments-and-big-lessons) song on repeat while prepping my work last night. It’s a great mix of guitar and piano, blending perfectly with Jeff Tweedy’s voice – love it.
