Scones have always slightly intimidated me. There seems to be some kind of exact consistency or method to the dough that I’ve always shied away from. I finally decided it was time for me to give it a try. Scones are such a universal baked item. No matter what season you’re in or taste you’re looking for {salty, savory, sweet, etc}, scones can fit the bill. I love the idea of adapting various fruits depending on the season. Or making some savory ones to dip into soups and stews during the cold winter months. And the idea of a scone and coffee in the morning sounds oh so appealing. Normally I would gravitate towards something much sweeter like a doughnut but scones just scream sophistication.

And…these turned out mediocre at best. I know it’s not the recipe, since I used [this one](http://www.breadtastic.com/quick-breads/tartines-strawberry-buttermilk-scones/) from the highly reputable [Tartine cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Tartine-Elisabeth-M-Prueitt/dp/0811851508/ref=sr_1_1/182-0505885-2094223?ie=UTF8&qid=1394159300&sr=8-1&keywords=tartine+cookbook). I failed in knowing exactly what consistency the dough needed to be at in order to produce the light flaky scone I wanted. Somehow it ended up too moist, making the end result way too dense. Also, I think I cut them too big. Surprisingly my husband thought they were great and ate them up {the same husband who isn’t too keen on sweets – go figure}. But I know I can do better. I’m armed with the knowledge of my failure and look forward to trying again.
