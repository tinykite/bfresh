I’m a huge fan of the Caprese Salad, as evidenced [here](http://justbfresh.com/2013/07/10/caprese-skewers/) and [here](http://justbfresh.com/2013/07/18/caprese-salad-with-eggplant/). It’s such a refreshing blend of three very awesome flavors {my favorite being the basil –  oh sweet sweet basil}. [Iowa Girl Eats](http://iowagirleats.com/), wise woman that she is, shakes up the original by adding a layer of awesomeness – avocado {recipe [here](http://iowagirleats.com/2013/09/02/avocado-and-chicken-caprese-salad/)}. We all know how much I love avocado, so obviously I didn’t hesitate to make this. Like any other salad of the fresh veggie variety, it was a cinch to make. Grilling the chicken only added about 10 minutes to the process and there was barely any slicing and dicing involved. Easily a 15 minute meal. I stuck with plain balsamic vinegar {didn’t bother with the stove} as the dressing and it turned out great.

Next time I make this I either need to make a smaller salad or leave out the chicken. Having both chicken and avocado make it quite filling.
