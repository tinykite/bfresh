I first posted something about my new-ish journey with yoga here, and I’m amazed at how differently I feel towards the practice than even just a few short months ago. I spoke of patience, humility and acceptance, but I’m surprised at how focused I was on the poses, and how getting further with those poses was driving my satisfaction.

I’ve noticed a shift since then. I don’t keep going back because of how much further I get with each pose {because let me tell you, that is at times a slow journey}. It’s the connection I feel to the practice, to myself, to the strength I feel in myself {even when I don’t hold as long or sit as low}. And it’s the connection I feel to those around me.

I met someone before class the other day {she loves Colorado as much as I do!} who is fairly new to the practice and had never taken that particular class before. I didn’t know this until after class when she told me she was watching me throughout class and following along with how I flowed. Following me! I consider myself to be a true beginner, and I really am, but it was the first time I stopped and considered that I have something to give as well. Normally I enter class with an attitude of learning, following, taking, absorbing. It was pretty powerful to be on the other end.

Another example of the amazing community I am a part of. We all play the part of teacher and student.

p.s. – for anyone in Des Moines looking for a great yoga studio, Power Life Yoga is an incredible community.
p.p.s. – Lululemon just opened a store at Jordan Creek Mall! Can anyone guess how dangerous this might be for me?!
