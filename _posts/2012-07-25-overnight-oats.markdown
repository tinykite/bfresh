My usual go-to breakfast during the work week is oatmeal. Oatmeal with peanut butter stirred in. It’s a simple kind of creamy goodness and considering my [love affair for peanut butter](http://justbfresh.com/2012/06/28/a-chocolate-treat/), it should come as no surprise that I utilize it as much as I can. The only thing is that it has gotten a tad bit old. Thus enters a variation on my trusted breakfast: overnight oats. It’s a colder, more refreshing version of oatmeal. So far I’ve only used vanilla yogurt, unsweetened almond milk, sliced bananas and raspberries but I’m looking forward to experimenting with other flavors. As the temperatures climb into the 100s this week, I’m glad I’ve found something cool {and healthy} to start my day with.
