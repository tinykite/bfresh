One of my favorite things about the weekends is being able to wake up and leisurely drink my coffee and make a fabulous breakfast. Breakfast is one of my favorite meals, but during the week I have to be at work so early, I usually default to making instant oatmeal to eat at my desk. Don’t get me wrong, I love oatmeal, but there are so many other amazing breakfast choices. Considering my sweet tooth {and the fact that I sometimes use breakfast as another time for dessert}, it’s probably a good thing I only get the opportunity to make a great breakfast a couple times a week. While I had a slight craving for something sweet, we opted instead for recreating the delicious yet admittedly not-so-good-for you McDonald’s sausage and egg mcmuffin.

No recipe to link to, but very easy to make.

1 lb spicy sausage {we used Jimmy Dean}
Eggs
Cheese {we tried several different flavors, but liked cheddar the best}
English muffins

Form the sausage into patties that will fit on the english muffins. Cook until browned all the way through. Fry the egg as you normally would, but break the yoke. Once it starts cooking, push the sides in on itself to round it into a size that will fit on the english muffins. Right before the sausage and egg are done, place a small slice of cheese on top to soften and melt a little. Salt and pepper, put on a toasted english muffin and enjoy!
