Iâ€™ve been spending the last few nights wallowing in my own self pity. And trying really hard to ignore that fact that my body is constantly ichingðŸ˜¦ Yup, the poison ivy prevails. Two doctorâ€™s visits and one phone call, one shot and two prescriptions later, and Iâ€™m still hoping against hope that these go away. Iâ€™m a pretty healthy person and spent most of my childhood in the great outdoors, and yet now, so many years later Iâ€™m encountering one of the worst things ever. Okay, there are plenty of much much worse things out there, Iâ€™m just being whiney.

Anyway, point is, I needed to get my mind off of it, so I decided to make another Pinterest recipe. Iâ€™m already behind if Iâ€™m trying to make two a week. I chose yet another variation on the Caprese Salad. This one is the more gown-up version with eggplant. I would definitely make it again â€“ and even piqued Brianâ€™s interest {shocking}.
