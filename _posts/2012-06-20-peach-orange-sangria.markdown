I’m always on the lookout for a new summer drink and this one stopped me in my tracks. Wine is my typical go-to but these past few days have been sweltering and the thought of sipping wine made me cringe a little bit. Just check out these current temperatures across the US. Wowza!

What better drink than one that will incorporate said staple drink in a refreshing, delicious, colorful way? This was the first time I made sangria and it won’t be the last. Just watch out. It’s a pretty potent drink.
