## Hey there!

B Fresh is a space I created to compile and share images, items, words, songs, really anything that inspires me and makes me smile. There’s a creative aspect that’s been missing in my life and this is my attempt to get those creative juices flowing again. I hope it continues to be a reminder to keep each day fresh, new and inspiring.

I don’t claim expert {or even amateur} knowledge on anything. What I do know is that I love to cook, bake and eat {only one of which I excel at}. And I love taking photos – a hobby I hope to pursue and develop. So you will find a smattering of food and photography here. Oh and Perrin. He’s cute.

While it could be seen as frivolous {I’m not discussing earth-shattering things here}, I cherish my tiny scrape of the blogosphere – it’s my escape. Thanks for stopping by!
xo, Bridget
